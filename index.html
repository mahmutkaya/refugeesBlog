          <h6>'ATTENTION THROUGH ART TO THE PROBLEMS OF REFUGEES'</h6>
    
    <p>Deputy Chairman of the Kimse Yok Mu Association Levent Eyuboglu pointed out that the suffering of the refugees who had to take shelter in other countries with their life threatened by their country, also continued in the roads and places where they were settled. Eyüboğlu said that those who showed the first sensitivity to the problems of the Syrians are the SAK volunteers, "We have over 70 million liras in Syria. Now we have organized an international cartoon contest to draw attention to art again. In addition to accepting European countries as governments, local people need to accept them as well. "</p>
          <p>Eyüboğlu said that his aim was to draw attention to the problems of all the refugees and to find solutions. "When people coming from Syria first come to Turkey, "We were so happy. When our children were playing in the street, when we were shopping, when we were having fun and going to our weddings one morning, everything was in place. We never expected. ' they said. That is what we want to emphasize in this competition; we can all be refugees any time. "</p>
    <h6>'CHARLIE HEBDO'S AYLAN BABY CARTOON'</h6>
    <p>The founder of the European Cartoon Center, Belgian cartoonist Rudy Gyhesens, said cartoons were more effective in revealing the reality of the living according to the media. Gyhesens also talked about the caricature of Charlie Hebdo cartoon magazine and the caricature of Aylan who reacts to the baby lifeless body in Bodrum. He said that both the people of Belgium and himself are very sorry.<br>
    T24 cartoon Tan Oral, who expressed that the cartoons are very influential on him, said, "The cartoonists who deal with the human and legal aspects of the problem described the desperation of the people coming from the south and the anxieties of the Europeans." Yeni Asya Newspaper cartoonist Ibrahim Ozdabak said, "I did not anticipate that we would encounter such beautiful works. It was very difficult for us to determine who was going to bite. "He conveyed his thoughts about the contest.<br>
    Cem Kiziltug, a Zaman newspaper, said that he always wanted to do something about refugees. "Cartoons came from many parts of the world and each one came out of a separate topic. We tried to pick out the things that would take people's minds, ask questions, get answers, and ironic things on the one hand. "</p>
